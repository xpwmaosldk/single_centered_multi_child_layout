The usage of this is very simple. 
It allows you to fix one widget in the center and place other widgets above, below, to the left, and to the right of it. 
Thereâ€™s no need to hide unnecessary widgets to align the same widget in the center on various dynamic screens.

It is very useful in the following situations.
